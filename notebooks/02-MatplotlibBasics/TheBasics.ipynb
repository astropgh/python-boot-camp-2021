    "The [matplotlib library](https://matplotlib.org/index.html) is one of the most useful and used tools within python. With its consistent and relatively simple framework, you can create complex publication-worthy figures with ease*. This session will cover the basics of plotting and formatting in the scripted framework, while Matplotlib II will introduce the object-oriented framework and a variety of plots. Various links are documented below, but I'll also include them here for ease:\n",

    "### Markers and Line Styles\n",
    "First, we'll look at the keyword arguments (```**kwargs```) that we can provide to make our lines look unique. We'll just look at a small selection that are available.\n",
    "1. ```color```: color of the line, can be an HTML color name ('red', 'darkred', 'black'), a hex string ('#008000'), RGB/RGBA tuple ((0,1,0,1)), grayscale intensities as a string ('0.5'), and several other settings I won't detail here\n",
    "2.  ```linestyle or ls```: style of the line that is plotted; can be 'None' or a variety of styles, like '-' for solid, '--' dashed, '-.' dashed dot, ':' dotted; default is '-', so you have to specify 'None' if you just want markers for points\n",
    "3.  ```linewidth or lw```: thickness of the line\n",
    "4.  ```alpha```: transparency of the line, with 1.0 => 100% => completely solid and so on\n",
    "5.  ```marker```: point style for markers; a few examples include 'o': circle; '.': point; 's': square; '*': star; 'v'/'^'/'<'/'>': triangle up/down/left/right\n",
    "6.  ```markersize or ms```: size of the markers\n",
    "7.  ```markeredgecolor or mec```: color of the marker edge; defaults to whatever the ```color``` kwarg is set to, but can be any valid color as described above\n",
    "8.  ```markeredgewidth or mew```: thickness of the marker edge\n",
    "9.  ```zorder```: order in which the points are displayed wherever they overlap, with lower numbers being displayed underneath higher zordered plot calls\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you provide a value to ```marker``` and ```ls``` is anything other than 'None', _including not specified_, then the marker will be plotted on top of a line of the same color as the marker. You can easily check this in the code below."

    "3. ```plt.xticks()```: allows for choosing placement and labels for major ticks; the first list or array of values determines the placement, and the second array determines the labels on those ticks; text attributes like color, fontsize, rotation, etc. also apply"

    "3. ```plt.grid()```: True or False for whether to include a grid; keywords include: ```which=``` determines the set of ticks that are gridded and can be 'major' or 'minor'*; ```axis=``` determines which axis gets gridded lines, and can be 'x', 'y', or 'both'\n",
    "4. ```ax = plt.gca()``` => ```ax.set_facecolor()```: changes the color in the plot's main face to any valid color; this looks a little different than most of the others, because it's verging on the object-oriented approach (next session!) but it's easy enough to show here\n",

The first arguemnt should be the filename as a string, including the file path, if it's not in the same directory as the notebook: 'your/file/path/goes/here/filename.extension', where the extension can be png, pdf, ps, and eps, amongst others.\n",

For plots like ours where some parts extend beyond where they're expected (thanks to the unusual axes labels, in our case), including ```bbox_inches='tight'``` can keep it from cutting off parts of the plot when saving. The keyword ```facecolor``` changes whether there's color behind the portion where the axes labels are. Adding ```facecolor='one'``` can make for an interesting effect on posters, where you might have a colored background behind the plot. The central portion will be white (or whatever you set the facecolor to be) and will stand out prominantly, while the axes labels will still be visible but there won't be a jarring white box around your plot, as you can see in the image below.\n",

This [website](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) shows you what an image looks like to those with different kinds of color-blindness. You can look at default image or upload your own. If you have time now or later, I suggest uploading your plot (must be .png) and see how your color choices hold up."
